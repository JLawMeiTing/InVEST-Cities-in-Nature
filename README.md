## Introduction

[Moja global](http://moja.global/) is a collaboration under the [Linux Foundation](https://linuxfoundation.org/) that aims for the widest possible collaboration on and use of credible tools to better manage the land sector. The flagship software is the [Full Lands Integration Tool (FLINT)](https://github.com/moja-global/flint), a tool to estimate emissions and sinks of greenhouse gasses from forestry and agriculture.

The Community website aims to serve a glimpse of moja global's projects and their work to the wider community. The website hosts projects, case studies, blogs, tutorials, and more developed by the wider moja community to help you better understand our work and hopefully learn from other's experiences.

Our mission is to help new users become familiar with the moja global community. We want to:

- Explain FLINT and the ecosystem surrounding it to anyone who is new to the ecosystem.
- Cover updates across the ecosystem to help users stay up to date.
- Bring Measure, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) software education to the community, in as many languages as possible.
- Assist new developers, writers, community managers and other contributors to get started on our projects.
- Provide them an opportunity to work on funded projects under the mentorship of the community members.
