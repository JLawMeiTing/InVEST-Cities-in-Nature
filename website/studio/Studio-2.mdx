## Learning Objectives ðŸŽ¯

- Understand the current approaches that Singapore is taking to address issues about sustainable environment
- Understand that national- or urban-level directions, agendas and programmes affect the city at the lower levels of organisation, such as the district-level
- Understand how the nature of the problem a district or a city faces involves multiple stakeholders and urban systems


## Tasks ðŸ”¨
- Conduct site vists to understand the allocated district 
- Conduct SWOT analysis in the perspective of different stakeholders within the team 
- Craft a problem statement/research question
- Identify key concern(s) of different stakeholders to be the focus of the studio project 

## Deliverables ðŸ“‚ 
- Describe and explain current approaches adopted by Singapore to address the issues found within the topic 
- Give your views on the strengths and limitations of these approaches 
- Identify a problem statement (see my earlier comment) for the allocated district/a specific area in the district: problem statement should relate to the discussion about Singapore by analysing how Singaporeâ€™s approaches have been implemented in the allocated district/a specific area in the allocated district and how they can improve 
- Justify this identification of the problem statement with supporting evidence from site analysis and secondary research, including the use of 2 types of InVEST model of the choice of the team
- Conduct a SWOT analysis of the district on the problem statement (i.e. what are the Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats possessed/faced by the district in being able to address the problem statement?)
- Identify relevant stakeholders that are being affected by the problem 
- Draw out a systems map that lists the Boundaries, Stakeholders, Systems involved in addressing the problem statement
