:::info Project Brief

In your group of 6, you are to self-assign each role below: 
+ Policy maker
+ Businessperson
+ Urban Professional
+ Member of the Community
+ Non-Governmental Organisation
+ Environmental activist

With the different roles, your team is required to study the allocated district using the topics taught within the two different themes: 1) Blue and Green in Nature, 2) Climate Resilient District. Using a systems approach, establish a clear understanding of the district and present a succinct introduction. You are to highlight the current condition on how green, blue or biophilic the district is by making reference to the policies, plans and/or programmes that government agencies like NParks, PUB or other agencies have implemented. Afterwhich, you are to conduct an analysis on how climate resilient the district is. 

With a clear understanding of the allocated district, identify problem(s) that your team would like to improve on to make the district a district in nature. Problems should be within the category of the “Sustainable Environment” of the Liveability Framework. Propose solution(s) in the form of policies, plans and/or programmes to the identified problem(s). Solutions should attempt to minimise environmental impacts while improving liveability of the district. Conduct detailed analysis and evaluation of the proposed solution(s) using a predictive model - inVEST and discuss possible benefit(s) and/or tradeoff(s). You are to use at least 2 inVEST models from the list below to aid your analysis and evaluation. 

List of InVEST models:
+ Carbon Storage and Sequestration
+ Urban Flood Risk Mitigation
+ Urban Cooling
+ Coastal Vulnerability

Here are some guiding questions for you to consider when developing your problem statement/research question: 
+ With climate change becoming an important issue, how could we do our part to limit global temperature rise?
+ One of the key targets of the Green Plan 2030 is to plant 1 million more trees. How would this affect us? 
+ How could we reduce the amount of carbon dioxide to limit global warming?
+ Being an island, Singapore is vulnerable to the rising sea level. How could we minimise the rate of rise and help coals thrive again?
+ How can we protect our coasts?
+ With the risk of extreme events like flooding, how could we think long term and plan ahead to mitigate such possible occurrences?
