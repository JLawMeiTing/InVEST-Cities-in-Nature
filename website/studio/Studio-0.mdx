## Project Brief

### Role Play
In your pre-assigned groups, you are to self-assign to one of the roles below:

| Role                          | Description |
| ----------------------------- | ----------- |
| Policy maker                  | Individuals in the government who are responsible for developing and amending policies to maximise the well-being of their citizens. <br /> <br /> Depending on the level (city, national, etc.) and field of their ministry (health, education etc.), their goals could include ensuring economic growth, maintaining social stability, or improving the lives of certain residential demographics that they represent. Policies can be specific or broad-based depending on the scale, project, and demographic that they are serving. <br /> <br /> Examples: Mayors, Ministers |
| Business person                | Leverage on existing and surrounding infrastructure to complement and add value to the development. <br /> <br /> Business persons are often driven by private organisational benefits such as increased financial standing and optimising asset values. <br /> <br /> Examples: Property Developer, Industralists, Investors |
| Urban professional            | Responsible for developing and designing urban areas that incorporate research and input from numerous stakeholders including citizens, property owners, investors, and government agencies. <br /> <br /> Urban professionals can have multiple goals such as improving quality of life, elevating nature, or pedestrianising a city through a planning or design-based lens. <br /> <br /> Examples: Urban Planner, Architect, Civil/M&E Engineer |
| Member of the community       | Aim to protect and represent the interests of specific communities and advocate for adequate representation. This may include petitioning for the conservation of specific sites, protecting the environment from overdevelopment, advocating for more culture and heritage preservation, or asking for more social spaces to be developed as opposed to commercial centres. <br /> <br /> Members of the community often seek transparency in decision-making processes as these translates to developments and regulations that directly affect their neighbourhoods and livelihoods. |
| Non-Governmental organisation | Non-profit entities that work to work towards public or social changes. <br /> <br /> These organisations are essential in developing the society and improve community engagement. They can be funded by grants or general donations. <br /> <br /> There are often different categories of NGOs: Community-based, City-wide based, National, and International. |
| Environmental activist        | Individuals who actively seeks to protect and care for the environment. They are concerned about all issues affecting the natural world of land, sea, air, plants, and animals. |

With the different roles, your team is required to study the allocated district using the topics taught within the two different themes:

- `Blue and Green in Nature`
- `Climate Resilient District` 

Using a systems approach, establish a clear understanding of the district and present a succinct introduction. You are to highlight the current condition on how green, blue or biophilic the district is by making reference to the policies, plans and/or programmes that government agencies like NParks, PUB or other agencies have implemented. With a clear understanding of the allocated district, identify problem(s) that your team would like to improve on to make the district a district in nature. Problems should be within the category of the ‚ÄúSustainable Environment‚Äù of the Liveability Framework. Propose solution(s) in the form of policies, plans and/or programmes to the identified problem(s). Solutions should attempt to minimise environmental impacts while improving liveability of the district. Conduct detailed analysis and evaluation of the proposed solution(s) using a predictive model - InVEST and discuss possible benefit(s) and/or tradeoff(s).

This will be a team effort and each member will role-play as different types of stakeholders to bring different perspectives in understanding the site problem(s) and agreeing on the solution(s). The challenge of the collaborative process will be to resolve competing interests between stakeholders and weighing trade-offs. You will be allocated to one of the two districts: [Central Area](#central-area) and [Queenstown](#queenstown). 


### District

![District](../static/img/central-and-queenstown-oultine.png)

#### Central Area
Home to a number of ethnic enclaves and neighbourhoods, Central Area is a distinct, cultural core that boasts a diverse range of enduring heritage areas. Originally a kampong, Chinatown housed many immigrants due to its proximity to the Singapore River. Today, it is Singapore‚Äôs largest District with four sub-districts. 

Kampong Glam, a former fishing village, saw the Istana Kampong Glam built by Sultan Hussain Mohammed Shah and maintains Malay-Arab influence today with the Sultan Mosque being designated as a national monument in 1975. Little India was the second settling point for Indian immigrants after the Chulia Kampong area became overcrowded and transformed into a bustling economic and activity hub. Other areas such as Golden Mile Complex and Peninsula Plaza host Thai and Burmese populations respectively.

#### Queenstown
Named after Queen Elizabeth II to mark her coronation in 1952, Queenstown was originally a swampy valley with two hills that evenutally became Singapore‚Äôs first satellite town. Initiated by the Singapore Investment Trust (SIT) in the 1950s, the area underwent significant development in the 1960s by the Housing and Development Board (HDB) as part of HDB‚Äôs first Five Year Building Programme.

Being a self-sufficient housing estate, Queenstown boasts a myriad of social, commercial, and economic infrastructure including many ‚Äòfirsts‚Äô of Singapore. Among these are Queenstown Public Library, Queenstown Polyclinic, and Queenstown Sports Complex.

As the oldest HDB town, the area underwent development again launched through the Development Guide Plan and Selective Enbloc Redevelopment Scheme that sought to rejuvenate the area and appeal to a dynamic and younger generation of residents.

### Studio Brief
- With a clear understanding of the allocated district, identify problem(s) that your team would like to improve on to make the district a district in nature. 
- Problems should be within the category of the ‚ÄúSustainable Environment‚Äù of the Liveability Framework. 
- Propose solution(s) in the form of policies, plans and/or programmes to the identified problem(s). 
- Solutions should attempt to minimise environmental impacts while improving liveability of the district. 
- Conduct detailed analysis and evaluation of the proposed solution(s) using a predictive model - InVEST and discuss possible benefit(s) and/or tradeoff(s). You are to use at least `2 InVEST models` (see model list [here](/docs/invest-intro)) to aid your analysis and evaluation. 

### Guiding Questions
Here are some guiding questions for you to consider when developing your problem statement/research question: 
+ With climate change becoming an important issue, how could we do our part to limit global temperature rise?
+ One of the key targets of the Green Plan 2030 is to plant 1 million more trees. How would this affect us? 
+ How could we reduce the amount of carbon dioxide to limit global warming?
+ Being an island, Singapore is vulnerable to the rising sea level. How could we minimise the rate of rise and help coals thrive again?
+ How can we protect our coasts?
+ With the risk of extreme events like flooding, how could we think long term and plan ahead to mitigate such possible occurrences?
