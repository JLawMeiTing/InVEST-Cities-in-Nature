Forestry xxx.

## Approach

xxx. 

The overall project was broken down in the following phases:

1. **Data pre-processing and feature engineering**: The data was collected xxx. 

2. **Baseline model implementation**: We implemented xxx.

3. **Deep learning model implementation**: We implemented xxx.

## Data Pre-Processing & Feature extraction

| Without resampling | Logistic Regression | Random Forest | SGD |
| ------------------ | ------------------- | ------------- | ----- |
| Accuracy | 0.95 | 0.97 | 0.95 |
| Precision | 1 | 0.993 | 0.998 |
| F1 | 0.947 | 0.97 | 0.947 |
| Recall | 0 | 0.6 | 0.008 |

> Results obtained without resampling the data to account for class imbalance.

| With downsampling | Logistic Regression | Random Forest | SGD |
| ----------------- | ------------------- | ------------- | ----- |
| Accuracy | 0.63 | 0.86 | 0.53 |
| Precision | 0.63 | 0.86 | 0.53 |
| F1 | 0.96 | 0.99 | 0.97 |
| Recall | 0.136 | 0.42 | 0.132 |

> Results obtained for Myanmar by implementing Hierarchical Bayesian Framework.
