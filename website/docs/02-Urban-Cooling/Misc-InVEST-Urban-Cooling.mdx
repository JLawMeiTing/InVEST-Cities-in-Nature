| :-------------------- |:------------------| :------------------ | :---: |
| Biophysical Table     |-                  | A table mapping each LULC code to biophysical data for that LULC class| Input |
| Shade                 |-                  | The proportion of area in this LULC class that is covered by tree canopy at least 2 meters high| Input |
| Crop coefficient      |Kc                 | Crop coefficient for this LULC class| Input |
| Green area            |-                  | Enter 1 to indicate that the LULC is considered a green area. Enter 0 to indicate that the LULC is not considered a green area| Input |
| Building intensity    |-                  | The ratio of building floor area to footprint area, with all values in this column normalized between 0 and 1 | Input |
| Urban heat island effect| UHI effect      | The difference between the rural reference temperature and the maximum temperature observed in the city| Input |
| Air Blending Distance |-                  | Radius over which to average air temperatures to account for air mixing | Input |
| Albedo                |-                  | The proportion of solar radiation that is directly reflected by this LULC class. Required if the â€˜factorsâ€™ option is selected for the Cooling Capacity Calculation Method                 | Output |
| Cooling capacity      |CC                 | Cooling capacity is the measure of a cooling system's ability to remove heat, which can be obtained based on local shade, evapotranspiration, and albedo| Output |
| Heat Mitigation Index |HMI                | HMI is equal to CC if the pixel is unaffected by any large green spaces, but otherwise set to a distance-weighted average of the CC values from the large green spaces and the pixel of interest| Output |
| Wet Bulb Globe Temperature| WBGT          | WBGT is widely used to quantify the impacts of heat on work productivity| Output |
| Air temperature       |T_air              | Average air temperature                 | Output |
| Energy savings        | -              | Energy savings are calculated based on an empirical relationship between energy consumption and temperature (e.g. summarized by [Santamouris et al. 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378778814007907?via%3Dihub))         | Output |
