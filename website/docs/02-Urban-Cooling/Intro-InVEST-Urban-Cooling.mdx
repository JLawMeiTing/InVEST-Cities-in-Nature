## Summary

> Urban heat mitigation (HM) is a priority for many cities that have undergone heat waves in recent years. Vegetation can help reduce the urban heat island (UHI) effect by providing shade, modifying thermal properties of the urban fabric, and increasing cooling through evapotranspiration. This has consequences for the health and wellbeing of citizens through reduced mortality and morbidity, increased comfort and productivity, and the reduced need for air conditioning (A/C). <br /> <br /> <p align="right">from [InVEST Documentation](https://invest-userguide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/urban_cooling_model.html)</p>

> The InVEST urban cooling model calculates an index of heat mitigation based on shade, evapotranspiration, and albedo, as well as distance from cooling islands (e.g. parks). The index is used to estimate a temperature reduction by vegetation. Finally, the model estimates the value of the heat mitigation service using two (optional) valuation methods: energy consumption and work productivity. <br /> <br /> <p align="right">from [InVEST Documentation](https://invest-userguide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/urban_cooling_model.html)</p>

## Data needs

Before running the InVEST Urban Cooling Model, you need to download all necessary data [here](https://xiaoganghe.github.io/InVEST-Cities-in-Nature/docs/Urban-Cooling/data/).

## How does the model work?
Add a video here.

or some texts.

## How to run the model?
![figure titled `JSON about the InVEST urban flood risk mitigation model`](../../static/img/UC-JSON.png)  

- Step 1: Running the model using all materials listed in the part of data requirement.  
- Step 2: The results of urban cooling model are described as the following figures. According to these figures, we can find that there exist some regions whose WBGT and T_air are clearly higher than their surrounding regions especially in urban districts (refer to [the distribution of land use type](https://xiaoganghe.github.io/InVEST-Cities-in-Nature/docs/Urban-Cooling/data/)). More insights into the energy savings should further take the distribution of buidings into consideration.
