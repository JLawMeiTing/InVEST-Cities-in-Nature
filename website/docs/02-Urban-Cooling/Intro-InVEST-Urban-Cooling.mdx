## Introduction

- The InVEST Urban Cooling Model calculates an index of heat mitigation based on evapotranspiration, shade and albedo, as well as distance from cooling islands (e.g. parks). The index is used to estimate a temperature reduction by vegetation [(source)](https://invest-userguide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/urban_cooling_model.html).

## Prerequisites

- Before running the module of Urban Cooling Model, you need to collect all necessary data, which has been listed in the [part of Data Requirement](https://xiaoganghe.github.io/InVEST-Cities-in-Nature/docs/Urban-Cooling/data/).

### How do modules work?

- Step 1: Running the model using all materials listed in the part of data requirement.  
![figure titled `JSON about the InVEST urban flood risk mitigation model`](../../static/img/UC-JSON.png)  

- Step 2: The results of urban cooling model are described as the following figures. According to these figures, we can find that there exist some regions whose WBGT and T_air are clearly higher than their surrounding regions especially in urban districts (refer to [the distribution of land use type](https://xiaoganghe.github.io/InVEST-Cities-in-Nature/docs/Urban-Cooling/data/)). More insights into the energy savings should further take the distribution of buidings into consideration.

### Frequently Asked Questions
1. What’s evapotranspiration and how to download this variable?  
   Evapotranspiration includes water evaporation into the atmosphere from the soil surface, evaporation from the capillary fringe of the groundwater table, and evaporation from water bodies on land ([source](https://www.usgs.gov/)). In this part, the evapotranspiration estimates provided by Simone are used for the period July 2012 to December 2016.
