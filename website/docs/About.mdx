## What is InVEST?
[**InVEST**](https://naturalcapitalproject.stanford.edu/software/invest) stands for <ins>**In**</ins>tegrated <ins>**V**</ins>aluation of <ins>**E**</ins>cosystem <ins>**S**</ins>ervices and <ins>**T**</ins>radeoffs. It is developed by Stanford's [Natural Capital Project](https://naturalcapitalproject.stanford.edu/).

[InVEST](https://naturalcapitalproject.stanford.edu/software/invest) is a family of tools for quantifying the values of natural capital in clear, credible, and practical ways. In promising a return (of societal benefits) on investments in nature, the scientific community needs to deliver knowledge and tools to quantify and forecast this return. InVEST enables decision-makers to quantify the importance of natural capital, to assess the tradeoffs associated with alternative choices, and to integrate conservation and human development.[^1]

## Model Suites

The InVEST Workbench has more than 15 models that can quantify nature's value related to water, food, energy, and carbon. See the full list [here](https://naturalcapitalproject.stanford.edu/software/invest). For our Studio Projects, we will be focusing on the following InVEST models:

- [**Urban Cooling**](/02-Urban-Cooling/Intro-InVEST-Urban-Cooling.mdx)
- [**Urban Flood Risk Mitigation**](/03-Flood-Risk-Mitigation/Intro-InVEST-Urban-Flooding.mdx)
- [**Coastal Vulnerability**](/04-Coastal-Vulnerability/Intro-InVEST-Coastal-Vulnerability.mdx)
- [**Carbon Storage and Sequestration**](/05-Carbon-Storage-and-Sequestration/Intro-InVEST-Carbon-Storage-and-Sequestration.mdx)
