## Introduction

- The InVEST Urban Flood Risk Mitigation Model calculates the runoff reduction, i.e. the amount of runoff retained per pixel compared to the storm volume. For each watershed, it also calculates the potential economic damage by overlaying information on flood extent potential and built infrastructure [(source)](https://invest-userguide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/urban_flood_mitigation.html).

## Prerequisites

- Before running the module of Urban Flood Risk Mitigation Model, you need to collect all necessary data, which has been listed in the [part of Data Requirement](https://xiaoganghe.github.io/InVEST-Cities-in-Nature/docs/Flood-Risk-Mitigation/data).

### How do modules work?

- Step 1: Running the model using all materials listed in the part of Data requirement  
![figure titled `JSON about the InVEST urban flood risk mitigation model`](../../static/img/UFRM-JSON.png)  

- Step 2: The related reults when rainfall=30 mm at present land use are presneted by the following figures. According to these figures, we can find that low runoff retention values mainly exist in the urban districts (refer to [land use at present](https://xiaoganghe.github.io/InVEST-Cities-in-Nature/docs/Flood-Risk-Mitigation/data/)). Menawhile, relatively high Q values are observed in the urban districts.

|:--:|
| Distribution of service values when rainfall=30 mm. |

- Step 3: The related reults when rainfall=100 mm at present land use are presneted by the following figures. We can find that Q values shown in these figures are clearly higher than that observed when rainfall=30 mm at present land use, indicating that higher rainfall may increase the occurency risk of high Q values.

|![the reults of rainfall=100 mm.](../../static/img/ufrm-100-service.png) |
|:--:|
| Distribution of service values when rainfall=100 mm. |

- Step 4: The related reults when rainfall=100 mm after land use change are presneted by the following figures. We can find that obvious changes have occured in this scenario regarding to the distribution of Q and runoff retention values after comparing with the previous scenarios, which indicates that land use can play a critical role in estimating the urban flood risk mitigation (refer to [land use after change](https://xiaoganghe.github.io/InVEST-Cities-in-Nature/docs/Flood-Risk-Mitigation/data/)).
