| Land use/Land cover	      | LULC               | Land use or land cover type | Input  |
| Calculate Sequestration   | -                  | Run sequestration analysis. This requires inputs of LULC maps for both current and future scenarios | Input  |
| Carbon pools              | -                  | A table that maps each LULC code to carbon pool data for that LULC type | Input  |
| Reducing Emissions from Forest Degradation and Deforestation| REDD              | REDD is a scheme for emissions reductions under which countries that reduce emissions from deforestation can be financially compensated | Input  |
