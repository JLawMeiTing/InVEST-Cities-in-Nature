## Summary

> The InVEST Carbon Storage and Sequestration model uses maps of land use along with stocks in four carbon pools (aboveground biomass, belowground biomass, soil, and dead organic matter) to estimate the amount of carbon currently stored in a landscape or the amount of carbon sequestered over time. <br /> <br /> <p align="right">from [InVEST Documentation](https://invest-userguide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/carbonstorage.html)</p>

## Data needs

Before running the InVEST Carbon Storage and Sequestration Model, you need to download all necessary data [here](./data).

## How to run the model?

![figure titled `JSON about the InVEST urban cooling model`](../../static/img/CSS-JSON.png)  

- Step 1: Running the model using all materials listed in the part of data requirement.  
- Step 2: The results of changes in carbon storage between year 2020 and 2050. The distributions of carbon storage for the present land use and the land use after change are presented in the following figures. We can find that there is a sigificant increase in carbon storage for the land use after change compared to that for the present land use. This phenomenon can be explained by that most part of the urban districts (ID=2) has been transformed into cultivated land (ID=6) during this process, which has a higher carbon pool data as shown in the [part of Data requirement](https://xiaoganghe.github.io/InVEST-Cities-in-Nature/docs/Carbon-Storage-and-Sequestration/about).

| ./                                            | `tot_c_cur.tif`                             | Maps showing the amount of carbon stored in each pixel for current scenarios. It is a sum of all of the carbon pools provided by the biophysical table. <br /> <br /> Unit: metric tons per pixel. |
| ./                                            | `tot_c_fut.tif`                             | Same as the above, but for future scenarios. |
| ./                                            | `delta_cur_fut.tif`                         | Maps showing the difference in carbon stored between the future landscape and the current landscape. |                                           |
| ./                                            | `npv_fut.tif`                               | Maps showing the economic value of carbon sequestered between current and future landscapes. <br /> <br /> Unit: currency per pixel. | 
| ./                                            | `report.html`                               | This file presents a summary of all data computed by the model. It also includes descriptions of all other output files produced by the model, so it is a good place to begin exploring and understanding model results. Because this is an HTML file, it can be opened with any web browser. |
| ./                                            | `*.txt`| The txt file lists the parameter values and output messages for that run and will be named according to the service, the date and time. |

:::note
Only key outputs are listed in the above table.

As reflected by its name, files in the `/intermediate` folder are intermediate output.
