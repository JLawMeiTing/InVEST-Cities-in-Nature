## Introduction
The InVEST Carbon Storage and Sequestration model uses maps of land use along with stocks in four carbon pools (aboveground biomass, belowground biomass, soil, and dead organic matter) to estimate the amount of carbon currently stored in a landscape or the amount of carbon sequestered over time([source](https://invest-userguide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/carbonstorage.html)).

## Prerequisites

Before running the module of Carbon Storage and Sequestration model, you need to collect all necessary data, which has been listed in the [part of Data requirement](https://xiaoganghe.github.io/InVEST-Cities-in-Nature/docs/Carbon-Storage-and-Sequestration/about).

## Frequently asked questions

1. What’s carbon pools?  
   It refers to a table that introduces all carbon pool data for each LULC type. More detailed information about this table you can refer to the [User’ Guide of InVEST model](https://storage.googleapis.com/releases.naturalcapitalproject.org/investuserguide/latest/carbonstorage.html#data-needs).
