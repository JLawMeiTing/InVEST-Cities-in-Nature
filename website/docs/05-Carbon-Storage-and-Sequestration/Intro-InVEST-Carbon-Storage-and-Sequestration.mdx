## Introduction
- The InVEST Carbon Storage and Sequestration model uses maps of land use along with stocks in four carbon pools (aboveground biomass, belowground biomass, soil, and dead organic matter) to estimate the amount of carbon currently stored in a landscape or the amount of carbon sequestered over time [(source)](https://invest-userguide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/carbonstorage.html).

## Prerequisites

- Before running the module of Carbon Storage and Sequestration Model, you need to collect all necessary data, which has been listed in the [part of Data requirement](https://xiaoganghe.github.io/InVEST-Cities-in-Nature/docs/Carbon-Storage-and-Sequestration/about).

### How do modules work?

- Step 1: Running the model using all materials listed in the part of Data requirement  
![figure titled `JSON about the InVEST Carbon-Storage-and-Sequestration`](../../static/img/CSS-JSON.png) 

- Step 2: The results of changes in carbon storage between year 2020 and 2050. The distributions of carbon storage for the present land use and the land use after change are presented in the following figures. We can find that there is a sigificant increase in carbon storage for the land use after change compared to that for the present land use. This phenomenon can be explained by that most part of the urban districts (ID=2) has been transformed into cultivated land (ID=6) during this process, which has a higher carbon pool data as shown in the [part of Data requirement](https://xiaoganghe.github.io/InVEST-Cities-in-Nature/docs/Carbon-Storage-and-Sequestration/about).
