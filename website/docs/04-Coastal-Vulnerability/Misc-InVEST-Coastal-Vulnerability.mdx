| :------------------------ | :------------------| :------------------ | :---:  |
| Landmasses            	  | -                  | Map of all landmasses in and around the region of interest  | Input  |
| WaveWatch III             | -                  | Map of gridded wind and wave data that represent storm conditions | Input  |
| Maximum Fetch Distance	  | -                  | Maximum distance in meters to extend rays from shore points | Input  |
| Bathymetry                | -                  | Map of bathymetry (ocean depth)                             | Input  |
| Geomorphology         	  | -                  | Map of relative exposure of each segment of coastline | Input  |
| Habitats Table            | -                  | Table that specifies spatial habitat data and parameters | Input  |
| Continental Shelf Contour | -                  | Map of the edges of the continental shelf or other locally relevant bathymetry contour| Input  |
| Population Search Radius  | -                  | The radius around each shore point within which to compute the average population density| Input  |
| Sea Level Rise            | SLR                | Map of sea level rise rates or amounts| Input  |
| Exposure                  | -                  | The model computes the coastal exposure index by combining the ranks of up to seven biological and physical variables at each shoreline point. Ranks vary from very low exposure (rank=1) to very high exposure (rank=5), based on a mixture of user- and model-defined criteria| Output  |
