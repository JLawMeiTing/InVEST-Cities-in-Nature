## Summary

> The InVEST Coastal Vulnerability Model produces a qualitative estimate of such exposure in terms of a vulnerability index, which differentiates areas with relatively high or low exposure to erosion and inundation during storms [(source)](https://invest-userguide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/coastal_vulnerability.html). Urban coastal ecosystems are especially important due to the large populations these limited ecosystems serve [(source)](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0163495). The purpose of this part is mainly to map coastal vulnerability and explore the role of sea level rise (SLR) and natural habitats played in influencing the relative exposure to coastal hazard. <br /> <br /> <p align="right">from [InVEST Documentation](https://invest-userguide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/urban_cooling_model.html)</p>

## Data needs

Before running the InVEST Coastal Vulnerability Model, you need to download all necessary data [here](./Data-InVEST-Coastal-Vulnerability.mdx).

## How does the model work?

or some texts.  

## How to run the model?
![figure titled `JSON about the InVEST urban flood risk mitigation model`](../../static/img/UFRM-JSON.png) 

- Step 1: Running the model using all materials listed in the part of Data requirement.  
- Step 2: The related reults under different rainfall intensity combined with land use are presneted by the following figures. According to these figures, we can find that low runoff retention values mainly exist in the urban districts (refer to [land use at present](https://xiaoganghe.github.io/InVEST-Cities-in-Nature/docs/Flood-Risk-Mitigation/data/)). Menawhile, relatively high Q values are observed in the urban districts. In addition, land use and rainfall intensity can play a critical role in estimating the urban flood risk mitigation.

| :------ | :------------------------:| :---------------------------------------- |
| ./      | `coastal_exposure.gpkg`   | This point vector file contains the final outputs of the model. The points are created based on the input model resolution, landmass, and area of interest|
| ./      | `coastal_exposure.csv`    |This is an identical copy of the attribute table of coastal_exposure.gpkg provided in csv format for convenience|
| ./      | `*.txt`                   | The txt file lists the parameter values and output messages for that run and will be named according to the service, the date and time|


:::note
Only key outputs are listed in the above table.

As reflected by its name, files in the `/intermediate` folder are intermediate output.
