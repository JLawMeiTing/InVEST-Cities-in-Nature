## Introduction
The InVEST Coastal Vulnerability Model produces a qualitative estimate of such exposure in terms of a vulnerability index, which differentiates areas with relatively high or low exposure to erosion and inundation during storms [(source)](https://invest-userguide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/coastal_vulnerability.html). Urban coastal ecosystems are especially important due to the large populations these limited ecosystems serve [(source)](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0163495). The purpose of this part is mainly to map coastal vulnerability and explore the role of sea level rise (SLR) and natural habitats played in influencing the relative exposure to coastal hazard.

## Prerequisites

Before running the module of Coastal Vulnerability Model, you need to collect all necessary data, which has been listed in the [part of Data requirement](https://xiaoganghe.github.io/InVEST-Cities-in-Nature/docs/Coastal-Vulnerability/data).

### How do modules work?

- Step 1: Running the model using all materials listed in the part of Data requirement.

- Step 2: The Relative exposure to coastal hazard when no added habitats and without considering sea level rise (hereafter SLR). According to this figure,

| The Relative exposure to coastal hazard when no added habitats and without considering SLR. |

- Step 3: The Relative exposure to coastal hazard when no added habitats and considering SLR. To further explore the role of sea level rise (SLR) played in influencing the relative exposure to coastal hazard, we further compared the coastal vulnerability results from the present scenario and that without considering SLR.

### Frequently asked questions

1. What’s the landmasses and how to download?  
   It mainly refers to the map of all landmasses in and around the region of interest. More detailed information about this file you can refer to the [User’ Guide of InVEST model](https://storage.googleapis.com/releases.naturalcapitalproject.org/investuserguide/latest/coastal_vulnerability.html#data-needs).
