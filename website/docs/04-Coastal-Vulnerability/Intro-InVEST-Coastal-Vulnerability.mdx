InVEST is xxx.
## Introduction
The InVEST Coastal Vulnerability model produces a qualitative estimate of such exposure in terms of a vulnerability index, which differentiates areas with relatively high or low exposure to erosion and inundation during storms([source](https://invest-userguide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/coastal_vulnerability.html)).

## Prerequisites

Before running the module of urban flood risk mitigation model, you need to collect all necessary data, which has been listed in the [part of Data requirement](https://xiaoganghe.github.io/InVEST-Cities-in-Nature/docs/Coastal-Vulnerability/data).
