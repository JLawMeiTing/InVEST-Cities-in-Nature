### Other Considerations

- (1) The influences of new added habitats (e.g., mangrove)?  
  In tihs study, the influences of new added habitats have been fully cosidered by comparing the reults of the relative exposure to coastal hazard under original habitats and that under another one new habitats. For example, some mangroves near to the coastal line may reduce the coastal exposure ([Hamza et al., 2022](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-445X/11/10/1714#:~:text=The%20results%20indicate%20that%20the,corals%20and%20seagrasses%20are%20lost.)). The following figures show some mangroves existed in Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve in Singapore.

| A mangrove is a shrub or tree that grows in coastal saline or brackish water. (Some photos showing the mangrove existed in Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve in Singapore) |

- (2) The influences of sea level rise (SLR)?  
  In tihs study, the influences of sea level rise have been fully cosidered by comparing the reults of the relative exposure to coastal hazard under original sea water level and that under another one new sea water level increased by 6 meters around the region of interest.

| Mean sea level around Singapore is projected to rise by up to 1m by 2100 according to the statistics published by PUB ([source](https://www.pub.gov.sg/)).
